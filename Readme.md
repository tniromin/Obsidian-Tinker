The urge to seek knowledge , curiosity , is almost old as humanity . However our brains can retain only a limited amount of such knowledge and the accuracy of such data is not reliable in the long term . Therefore the need for retention of such knowledge was realized . One of the main reasons for an unhindered development of the human civilization can be partly attributed to the retention and recording of knowledge , with exceptions .

Obsidian is a modern tool for taking notes and storing knowledge . Automation within obsidian is easily achieved with the wide variety of community pluggins thus making note taking more efficient and fun . The Main goal of this Repo is to Store such techniques that are implemented using such pluggins . I hope this will be useful for anyone with similar interests or requirements. <b> Feel free to request , suggest or share your own knowledge as well .</b>
